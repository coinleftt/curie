"""Pydantic models for the Claude Code plugin bundle shape (verbatim).

Compatibility with the Claude Code plugin format is the distribution wedge, so
these models mirror the real shapes and are deliberately permissive: unknown
keys are allowed, not rejected, because real bundles carry fields this MVP does
not model (and future Claude Code versions will add more). The models capture
the fields the platform reads; validators in ``validate.py`` turn structural
problems into actionable errors.

Shapes covered:
    .claude-plugin/plugin.json   PluginManifest
    skills/**/SKILL.md           SkillFrontmatter (YAML frontmatter)
    .mcp.json                    McpConfig / McpServer
