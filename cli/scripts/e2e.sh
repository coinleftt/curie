# Scripted E2E for the curie CLI (task I1 done-when).
#
# Round-trips a synthetic event through a real local runner container with zero
# Slack involved: init a bundle, start the runner (fake model, offline by
# default; live model under CURIE_E2E_LIVE=1), send a message and stream the
# NDJSON reply, run the eval cases, stop. This is rung 1 (skill) of the
# cold-start parity ladder (issue #690, cli/scripts/e2e-ladder.sh); the
# ladder's local rung (`local deploy` -> `local message` with a real reply
# assertion) covers deploying a bundle against a running platform API, so this
# script no longer does so itself (issue #694).
#
# Requirements: docker, a curie-runner image (build per runner/README.md),
# and a cargo toolchain (or $CURIE_BIN). Run from anywhere:
#
#   bash cli/scripts/e2e.sh
#
# Env knobs:
#   CURIE_E2E_IMAGE     runner image (default curie-runner)
#   CURIE_E2E_PORT      host port (default 7245)
#   CURIE_E2E_NETWORK   docker network to join (e.g. curie_default)
#   CURIE_E2E_OTEL      OTLP endpoint (e.g. http://otel-collector:4318)
#   CURIE_E2E_LIVE      1 = real model, requiring a credential in the
#                         environment (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN,
#                         or CURIE_CREDENTIALS); default 0 runs the runner's
#                         scripted fake model, offline and credential-free. This
#                         is the SAME env var cli/scripts/e2e-ladder.sh sets for
#                         its own local and cluster rungs, so a single
#                         CURIE_E2E_LIVE=1 now runs every rung live.
#   CURIE_BIN           path to a prebuilt curie binary (skip cargo build)
