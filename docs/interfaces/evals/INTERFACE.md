# INTERFACE: Evals (case + scorer)

> Part of the AgentOS swappable-seam catalog — see the [seam index](../../interfaces.md).
> **Kind:** SOFT (scorer slot now a typed `Scorer` Protocol) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Implementations today:** 2 scorers (grader family + deterministic trajectory matcher) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Swap-readiness grade:** B

**Kind legend:** CLEAN = a real `Protocol`/typed port class · SOFT = swap via env/URL/prefix/wire, no code interface · NONE = not built yet.

## The black line

The eval seam is defined by two wire contracts, not a code interface: the `agentos:evals` Valkey stream schema (request in) and the `EvalMatrix` DTO the API reads back (results out). The scorer/grader slots in *above* the port (a case names a grader; the runner applies it), and the result store (Langfuse) sits *behind* the recorder. Swapping either the grader family or the store means honoring the same stream payload and the same version/suite-tagged trace+score shape; the stream, the recorder's tag convention, and the matrix DTO are the opinionated core.

## Current contract

Request side — one stream field `payload` (`STREAM_PAYLOAD_FIELD`, `apps/worker/src/agentos_worker/eval/stream.py:72`) holding an `EvalWorkItem` JSON (`stream.py:76`): `agent_id`, `version_id`, `sha`, `suite`, `bundle_ref`, `target_url`, `requested_at`. Consumer group `agentos-eval-workers` reads it (`stream.py:6`, `stream.py:181`).

Case + grader models — `EvalCase` is `{id, input, grader}` (`eval/models.py:53`); `Grader` is `{kind: GraderKind, expected, case_sensitive}` (`models.py:26`) where `GraderKind` is the enum-dispatched family `EXACT | CONTAINS | REGEX` (`models.py:18`), applied by `Grader.grade(output)` (`models.py:39`). This is the single "grader family" — deny-by-default, string-shaped only.

Scorer seam — the pass/fail decision is now a swappable `Scorer` Protocol above the port (`eval/scorer.py`): `score(case, output, trajectory) -> ScoreResult`. `EvalRunner` captures both the answer text and the tool-call `trajectory` (the ordered `tool` field of each `tool_note` frame) and delegates to an injected scorer, defaulting to `GraderScorer` (the frozen grader over the text — behavior-preserving). The second, tier-1 scorer is `TrajectoryScorer`: a deterministic matcher over the tool-call sequence with modes `EXACT | IN_ORDER | ANY_ORDER | PRECISION | RECALL`, configured above the port via a `case_id -> TrajectorySpec` mapping the run layer supplies (NOT a field on the frozen case — a per-case trajectory expectation would change the frozen eval-case schema, deliberately out of scope). LLM-judge and hosted-eval-API scorers are the later, costlier tiers; they conform to the same Protocol but are not built.

Result side — `LangfuseEvalRecorder.record()` (`eval/recorder.py:47`) posts, per case, a trace tagged `["eval", f"version:{run.version}", f"suite:{run.suite}"]` (`recorder.py:82`) plus an `eval_pass` numeric score `1.0/0.0` (`SCORE_NAME`, `recorder.py:25`; `_score_event`, `recorder.py:96`). The read path is `GET /matrix` returning `EvalMatrix`, querying traces by those tags (`apps/api/src/agentos_api/routers/evals.py:16`; `list_traces_by_tags(["eval", f"suite:{suite}"])` at `evals.py:23`).

Model dimension (issue #255, BYO-model epic #24) — additive, same convention as `version:`/`suite:`. A run carries the model id it ran under on `EvalRunResult.model`, which the recorder emits as a `model:<name>` tag plus a `metadata.model` field (and a per-case `metadata.cost_usd` when available). `build_matrix` reads them back (`_model_of`/`_cost_of`) into `EvalCell.model` and a per-model `EvalModelSummary` rollup (pass-rate + summed cost) on `EvalMatrix.model_summaries`, so a suite is sliceable by model for pass-rate/cost comparison. Runs with no resolved model (the `target_url` shortcut) record no `model:` tag and fall into the unlabelled column. **UI surfacing of `model_summaries` (a model column/toggle on the matrix grid) is not built here — the API DTO carries it; the console has yet to render it.** The recorder does not yet compute `cost_usd` from live usage (the ACI wire carries no usage block), so cost is present-but-`None` until a usage/pricing source is threaded — a deliberate follow-up.

Prompt-cache observability (issue #255) — `_GenerationSpan.record_usage` (`runner/src/agentos_runner/otel.py`) now also stamps `cache_read_input_tokens`/`cache_creation_input_tokens` on the generation span, and `agentos_runner.cache` classifies a turn's usage as a warm cache hit. The prompt-cache smoke test (`runner/tests/test_prompt_cache.py`) drives a two-turn warm thread through the real `SessionRunner` and fails loudly if the second turn does not report cache reads — the signal a translating gateway silently broke caching.

## Implementations today

Two scorers through the `Scorer` seam — the three-variant deterministic grader family (`GraderScorer`, the default) and the deterministic tool-call trajectory matcher (`TrajectoryScorer`, five modes) — and one store (Langfuse, via `LangfuseEvalRecorder`). Both scorers write results through the identical recorder/`EvalRunResult` path. No LLM-judge/hosted scorer and no second store adapter exists yet.

## Known leakage

One seam still bleeds through. The eval-case format is now converged and frozen (issue #8, ADR-0019): both the CLI scaffold/loader (`cli/src/evals.rs`) and the worker's `load_suite_from_bundle` (`stream.py:143`) build to one schema, `apps/worker/schema/eval-cases.schema.json`, generated from the Pydantic `EvalSuite`/`EvalCase`/`Grader` models (`models.py`) and guarded by the same regenerate-and-diff drift gate as the frozen packages. The CLI hand-mirrors the schema in Rust and is kept honest by a byte-level conformance test against the shared committed fixture. Still open: the `version:`/`suite:` trace-tag convention is an unfrozen string contract hand-aligned between the recorder (`recorder.py:82`) and the matrix reader (`evals.py:23`) — a rename on one side silently breaks the grid.
