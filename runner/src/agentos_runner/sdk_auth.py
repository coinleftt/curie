"""Map the ACI ``AGENTOS_CREDENTIALS`` reference onto the SDK's credential env.

The claude-agent-sdk authenticates from ``CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`` /
``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` in its own environment; it never reads the ACI
``AGENTOS_CREDENTIALS`` reference. When the platform supplies only
``AGENTOS_CREDENTIALS`` (the worker forwards it), the runner would otherwise drop
it and the real session would fail with a generic ``authentication_failed``. This
resolves it to the correct SDK variable before the session starts.

Rules (order matters -- an OAuth token and an API key share the ``sk-ant-``
prefix, so the more specific OAuth prefix is checked first):
- An explicit SDK credential already in the environment wins (the platform set it
  deliberately); this is then a no-op.
- ``sk-ant-oat...`` is a Claude Code OAuth token -> ``CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN``.
- ``sk-ant-...`` (any other) is an Anthropic API key -> ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``.
- ``sk-or-...`` (OpenRouter) is routed through the base-URL-override seam:
  base URL -> OpenRouter's Anthropic endpoint, key -> ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``
  (the ``x-api-key`` header OpenRouter reads), and ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN``
  left blank. A bare ``sk-...`` OpenAI-style key is still rejected loudly on the
  direct-Anthropic path (no base URL set).
- Anything else is treated as a Claude Code OAuth token ->
  ``CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN``.

Provider-native Anthropic-compatible endpoints (Zhipu/GLM, Moonshot/Kimi,
DeepSeek, ...) share OpenAI's ``sk-`` key shape or use a non-``sk-`` key, so a
key prefix cannot select them unambiguously. They are instead selected by base
URL: the config author points ``AGENTOS_MODEL_BASE_URL`` (or the raw SDK var
``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``) at the provider's ``/anthropic`` endpoint and supplies
the provider key in ``AGENTOS_CREDENTIALS``. In that base-URL-override mode the
provider key is forwarded into ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` (the ``x-api-key`` header
these endpoints read). Canonical base URLs live in ``PROVIDER_BASE_URLS``. A
Claude Code OAuth token (``sk-ant-oat``) is never forwarded to a third-party
endpoint -- override mode keeps it blanked (hermetic).

The endpoint's wire protocol is **declared, not inferred** (#514).
``AGENTOS_MODEL_API_BACKEND`` names it as an ``ApiBackend`` member and defaults to
``messages``, which is the only wire format the runner can dial: the session runs
on claude-agent-sdk, which speaks the Anthropic Messages format. The
OpenAI-shaped backends (``chat_completions``, ``responses``) are therefore
declarable but rejected up front, in ``resolve_sdk_env``, before any credential or
base-URL branching -- a deterministic gate, so an OpenAI-shaped endpoint fails
loudly with an actionable message instead of being silently mis-dialed. Reaching
one needs a translating proxy in front of the runner.

Which env var carries the credential is likewise declarable (#514).
``AGENTOS_MODEL_ENV_KEY`` holds either a bare env-var name or a JSON array of
them; the keys are walked in order and the first that is both set and non-empty
wins, so a config author is not forced onto the single hardcoded
``AGENTOS_CREDENTIALS`` name. A key that is present but EMPTY is skipped rather
than winning -- an empty value is "not supplied", never a credential. Unset or
empty, the list defaults to ``(AGENTOS_CREDENTIALS,)``, which is exactly today's
behavior. What it may TARGET is fenced: the boot env also holds the platform's
scoped state tokens (ADR-0033) and the agent's connector secrets, so an
``AGENTOS_``-prefixed target (other than ``AGENTOS_CREDENTIALS`` itself) is
refused, keeping the declaration from becoming a way to forward the platform's
own secrets to a third-party endpoint.

The credential value (and its length) is never logged or echoed.
