"""Classify a tool call as idempotent (safe) or side-effecting.

The ACI ``side_effect_flag`` gates the no-retry-after-side-effects rule (ACI
section 2b): a failed run that executed a non-idempotent tool escalates to a
human instead of retrying, because at-least-once delivery plus a mutating tool
means a blind retry risks a duplicate real-world action.

Design choice (documented for F1/K1): a **read-only allowlist**, deny-by-default.
A small set of known read-only Claude Code tools is treated as idempotent; every
other tool the harness executes is treated as potentially side-effecting and
flags the run. This fails safe: a new or unknown tool escalates rather than
being silently retried. The alternative, an explicit non-idempotent denylist,
fails open (a new mutating tool would be missed) and was rejected for that
reason. The allowlist is overridable via ``AGENTOS_IDEMPOTENT_TOOLS`` (a comma
separated list that replaces the default) so an operator can widen it per plugin
without a code change.
