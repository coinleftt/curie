"""OTel tracing for the runner: gen_ai spans exported OTLP-HTTP to the collector.

Productizes the PT-4/PT-E prototype span shape. Each turn is a root ``agent.run``
(SERVER) span carrying a ``langfuse.trace.name``, with a child ``llm.generation``
span holding ``gen_ai.request.model`` and ``gen_ai.usage.*`` token counts, plus a
child ``execute_tool`` span per tool call (``gen_ai.tool.name`` /
``gen_ai.operation.name``). Langfuse maps a model-bearing span to a generation and
nests tool spans as observations, so this reconstructs the tool-call tree (S1).

Traces go to the OTel Collector over OTLP-HTTP, never directly to Langfuse: the
collector is the adapter that authenticates and forwards (Langfuse OTLP ingest is
HTTP-only). Endpoint/headers come from the standard ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`` env
vars via ``SessionConfig.otel``; the exporter is constructed argument-free so the
opentelemetry SDK's own env parsing applies (it appends ``/v1/traces`` to a base
``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT``). When no endpoint is configured the tracer is a
no-op, so unit tests and offline runs neither export nor fail.
