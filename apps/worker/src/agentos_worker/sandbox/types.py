"""Sandbox substrate types: the claim handle, route record, config, and errors.

The substrate is the G1 seam between the worker kernel (F1) and the
kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox runtime. F1 talks in ``thread_key`` (the Slack
``thread_ts``, or any stable per-conversation key) and receives a
``SandboxHandle`` naming the claimed sandbox and its dial target. Everything
Kubernetes-shaped stays behind this module.
