"""Per-model token pricing for attributing a dollar cost to an eval turn (#390).

The eval runner knows a turn's token usage (carried on the ACI ``final`` event)
and the model it ran under; this module is the third input -- the price of those
tokens. Pricing lives here, on the consumer side, not on the wire: the ACI wire
carries raw usage, and what a token costs is a billing concern the recorder/matrix
own, not a property of the protocol.

The table is deny-by-default: a model id with no entry prices to ``None`` (cost
unknown) rather than to a guessed number, so a run under an unpriced model simply
falls out of the matrix's cost rollup instead of polluting it. That is also why
the fake-model path never gets a cost -- ``CURIE_FAKE_MODEL`` is not a real
model and is deliberately absent from the table.

Prices are USD per one million tokens, split input/output, matching Anthropic's
published list pricing (https://www.anthropic.com/pricing, list as of 2026-07).
Keep this list-price-only: eval cost is a coarse comparison signal across models,
not a billing ledger, so it does not model prompt-cache discounts, batch pricing,
or per-region multipliers.
