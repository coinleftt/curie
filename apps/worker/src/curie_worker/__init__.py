"""Curie worker: concurrency kernel, sandbox substrate, evals.

F1 adds the concurrency kernel: the consumer group over the dispatcher's Valkey
stream, the routing / finish-race / steer / interrupt rules, no-retry-after-
side-effects with human escalation, and crash-recovery reclaim. G1 owns the
``sandbox`` substrate module; K1 will add the eval runner.
